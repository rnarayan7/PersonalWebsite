            <h3>Indian Student Coalition at Bellarmine College Preparatory</h3>
            <p>
                At BCP, I served as the President of the Indian Student
                Coalitions and organized a sold out cultural Bollywood dance show, Nazaara, for two years. In this
                experience, I learned valuable lessons about working with others and managing a project, from communication,
                to time management, to inspiring others, and showing leadership. We were able to generate over 9 thousand
                dollars in cash over those two years that supported a foundation known as OSAAT, which builds schools
                for impoverished children in rural India. But more than all of this, it was an opportunity for me to act
                and dance in front of a crowd of wonderful people, and meet tons of friends in the process.
