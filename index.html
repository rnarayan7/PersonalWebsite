      <h3>Michigan Izzat</h3>
      <p>Upon entering college, I joined Michigan Izzat, UM's all-male Bollywood Fusion dance team.
        We are a group of about 30 dancers who compete nationally across the United
        States with the hopes of qualifying and potentially winning the Bollywood Fusion national
        championships (Bollywood America and Legends) at the end of year. Given that fusion dance
        combines a number of different styles, including hip hop, bhangra, and Bollywood dancing,
        learning to perform with the team has been a challenging albeit rewarding experience.

      <h3>Indian Student Coalition at Bellarmine College Preparatory</h3>
      <p>At BCP, I served as the President of the Indian Student
        Coalitions and organized a sold out cultural Bollywood dance show, Nazaara, for two years. In this
        experience, I learned valuable lessons about working with others and managing a project, from communication,
        to time management, to inspiring others, and showing leadership. We were able to generate over 9 thousand
        dollars in cash over those two years that supported a foundation known as OSAAT, which builds schools
        for impoverished children in rural India. But more than all of this, it was an opportunity for me to act
        and dance in front of a crowd of wonderful people, and meet tons of friends in the process.

        <h3>Film</h3>
        <p>A couple of my middle school friends and I competed each year in an Evergreen
          Film Festival, where we presented short films we had created. We were nominated in categories of
          Best Documentary, Best Original Film, and Best Instructional Video, and took first place in both
          Documentary and Original Film. Shown below are our 2nd and 3rd year films.
