    <h3>Welcome to my site!</h3>
    <p>My name is Roshan Narayan and I am currently a freshman in the University of
      Michigan College of Engineering, where I will be pursuing a Bachelor's degree in the department of
      Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My hometown is San Jose, California, and I recently
      graduated from Bellarmine College Preparatory. At BCP, I served as the President of the Indian Student
      Coalitions and organized a sold out cultural Bollywood dance show, Nazaara, for two years. In this
      experience, I learned valuable lessons about working with others and managing a project, from communication,
      to time management, to inspiring others, and showing leadership. We were able to generate over 9 thousand
      dollars in cash over those two years that supported a foundation known as OSAAT, which builds schools
      for impoverished children in rural India. But more than all of this, it was an opportunity for me to act
      and dance in front of a crowd of wonderful people, and meet tons of friends in the process. Aside from
      this, some of my interests include basketball, football, dance, cars hacking, select film and literature,
      creating solutions, and exploring philosophy and psychology. Evidently, I have a variety of interests and
      hope to explore each one of them further. Feel free to contact me.

        <h3>Film And Literature</h3>
        <p>A group of myself and a couple of my middle school friends competed each year in an Evergreen
          Film Festival, where we presented short films we had created. We were nominated in categories of
          Best Documentary, Best Original Film, and Best Instructional Video, and took first place in both
          Documentary and Original Film. Shown below are our 2nd and 3rd year films.
