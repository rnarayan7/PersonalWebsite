            <h3>Film</h3>
            <p>
                A couple of my middle school friends and I competed each year in an Evergreen
                Film Festival, where we presented short films we had created. We were nominated in categories of
                Best Documentary, Best Original Film, and Best Instructional Video, and took first place in both
                Documentary and Original Film. Shown below are our 2nd and 3rd year films.
