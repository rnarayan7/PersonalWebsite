            <h3>Films</h3>
            <p>
                A couple of my middle school friends and I competed each year in an Evergreen
                Film Festival, where we presented short films we had created. We were nominated in categories of
                Best Documentary, Best Original Film, and Best Instructional Video, and took first place in both
                Documentary and Original Film. Shown below are our 2nd and 3rd year films.

                I am also an avid movie enthusiast. After a class I took while at Bellarmine College Prep called
                Film Composition and Literature, I began to appreciate aspects of dialogue, cinematography,
                plots, and score. Since then, I have watched countless movies, and have developed a unique liking
                for Italian mob movies (Godfather, Goodfellas) as well as mind-bending thrillers (The Usual Suspect).
                I am planning to build out the portion of this website dedicated to film with some more of my thoughts
                and reviews of movies that I have seen. For now, I will list out some of my favorite movies.
